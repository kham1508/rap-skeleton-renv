An image should not replace a clear text description so ensure any information presented in an infographic is presented elsewhere. Add alt text for anyone using a screen reader. For more specific guidance about accessible infographics refer to Dissemination Branch document 'Creating an accessible infographic'. For more general guidance you can also refer to [Government Statistical Service (GSS) guidance on infographics](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/infographics/) but note that as of 20/8/21 it does not include accessibility requirements.

### Type the title of infographic here (h3)

```{r infographics, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, fig.alt = "Population increase from 2018 to 2043 due to relative contributions of natural change and net migration.", out.width="100%"}

#file is in image folder
knitr::include_graphics("../demo/demo_data/images/PopInfographic.png")
```
