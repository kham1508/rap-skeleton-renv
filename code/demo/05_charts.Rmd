This section includes a line chart with a single line, a line chart with multiple lines, a bar chart, a column chart, a pie chart, a tree map and a donut chart.

Considerations when creating charts:

Accessibility

* Do not rely on colour alone to convey information - ensure colour contrast ratios between chart elements and chart background is sufficient
* ONS recommend that you link to the raw data in csv or xls format or provide a way for users to request it
* Chart titles should be descriptive. A main title and statistical subtitle should be used (e.g. main title 'Figure 1: The gender pay gap fell to 8.6% among full-time employees in 2018') and statistical subtitle should include statistical measure, geographic coverage and time period (e.g. 'Gender pay gap for median gross hourly earnings (excluding overtime), UK, April 1997 to 2019')
* Charts should include a line of alt text (to include chart type, type of data used and summary of main trend); all detail should be in main text
* All text on a chart should be presented horizontally (including axis labels)
* Axis labels should be displayed in full (i.e. not abbreviated)
* Where abbreviations are included they should be in full, or explained in footnotes
* Try to avoid a legend (especially if they rely on colour alone to convey meaning), but if legend is needed place above the chart
* Where possible, charts should be created in HTML (i.e. interactive), and where not possible, in SVG image format (this exemplar contains examples of both)
* Data included in charts should be clearly explained in text format around the chart
* Avoid using dual axis charts
* Consider punctuation on labels of interactive charts and how a screen reader will vocalise them
* Consider how charts will resize for different display sizes e.g. mobile, laptop or desktop; a message has been added for mobile users to suggest rotating phone to landscape for viewing charts


### Single line chart (h3)

This section includes a static and reactive version of a line chart. 

The line has to meet colour contrast standards for adjacent colours (3:1). In this case it applies to the line against the background.

The value labels have to meet the colour contrast requirements for normal sized text which is 4.5:1. Here, the labels are placed at the ends of the line to make them easier to read and to avoid any problems with overlap if the chart is resized when viewed on different devices or browsers. 

Include descriptive text before or after the chart.

### Multiple lines chart (h3)

This section includes a line chart with more than one series which are not overlapping. 

Although these lines are not touching or crossing we have used colours that meet the contrast requirements for adjacent colours to help users perceive the difference. The dark blue and light blues meet the 3:1 contrast and the text for both of these colours meets the 4.5:1 contrast for text against the background.

A static chart is used here so it views well on mobile as well as desktop. Annotations easily get crowded and overlap when resized and the chart resizes the x axis which alters how the trend is perceived.

Include descriptive text before or after the chart.

### Multiple single line charts (h3)

This section changes from multiple lines on one chart to include a small chart for each grouping specified (i.e. LGD2014 as below).

In situations where you have a larger number of lines, consider using small multiples to either highlight trends against noisy backgrounds or present trends side by side. You could highlight a single line in colour and have the other lines in grey or just show individual lines as demonstrated below.

This is a static chart as it is more mobile friendly.

Include descriptive text before or after the chart.

#### Figure 3: In `r latest_year`, Belfast Local Government District (LGD) has more younger people than other areas
##### Northern Ireland mid year population estimate by LGD in `r latest_year`

### Bar chart (a-z) (h3)

This section includes a bar chart sorted in alphabetical Local Government District (LGD) order. A bar chart was chosen so that the LGD names could be displayed in full horizontally. 

Include descriptive text before or after the chart.


#### Figure 4: Young people by LGD
##### Data from `r latest_year` mid-year estimates (MYEs) showing the percentage of each LGD population that is under 25

                                    ),
        #removes grids from chart
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        # added vertical grid at major ticks
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "#BEBEBE", linewidth = 0.1), 
        # removes chart border top and right
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        # xaxis line black
        axis.line.x = element_line(colour = "#000000"),
        # yaxis line black
        axis.line.y = element_line(colour = "#000000"),

              data_style = ns_percent,
              data_dir = demo_data_dir)

```



The chart shows that LGD with the greatest percentage of population less than 25 is Mid Ulster. Ards and North down is the LGD with the smallest percentage.

### Interactive bar chart (h3)
This bar chart is created using the same data but using plotly to create an interactive html chart. Title is used for statistical title and h4 for descriptive title. 

When resized for mobile the bars shorten but the labels remain a more readable size. Keep the x axis title short so it won't get cut off on a smaller display.

Include descriptive text before or after the chart highlighting the key message.

#### Figure 5: Proportion of under 25s was higher in `r earliest_year`.
##### Percentage of population aged under 25 by LGD, `r earliest_year` MYEs

Dashed line represents NI mean.

The chart shows that LGD with the greatest percentage of population under 25 in `r earliest_year` was Derry City and Strabane. Ards and North down was the LGD with the smallest percentage.

### Column chart (h3)

This section includes 2 versions of a column chart (one static, one interactive) and 2 stacked bar charts. To ensure colour is not the only  means of conveying information, contrast is used to differentiate between male and female columns and data labels have been added.

In this instance, the plotly grouped bar chart resizes well because the x axis labels are short and don't overlap when resized. The data labels will change to vertical on mobile which is not ideal (should be horizontal) but the hover labels will be horizontal and legible.

The stacked bars have been created in plotly. They resize well for small screens because the age group labels are short and don't overlap. The horizontal stacked bar also resizes well because there are only 2 groups. If there were many more a static chart would likely be more appropriate.

Include descriptive text before or after the chart.

### Pie chart (h3)

Ensure that colour is not the only means of conveying meaning. Here value labels are added for alternative source of information. Borders are used to meet contrast requirements.

These pie charts have been placed in 2 columns so that when resized for mobile they will wrap one under the other and remain legible.

Include descriptive text before or after the chart.

### Treemap (h3)

Tile size and value labels are sources of meaning in addition to colour in the treemap. Again, text must meet 4.5:1 contrast and adjacent colours 3:1.

Borders are used around the tiles to ensure the contrast requirements are met. These are needed for NISRA green and the pale blue.

Include descriptive text before or after the chart.

### Donut chart

This donut chart has 4 sections and ONS have devised a sequential colour scheme that can be used in visualisations like this where more colours are needed and the order can be preserved. It's important that these colours appear in order to retain required contrast.

Keep labels short and concise when using plotly for donut so that labels remain visible on mobile.
